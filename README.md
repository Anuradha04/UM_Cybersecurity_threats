# Cybersecurity Threat Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cybersecurity data analysis using machine learning, employing Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and K-Means clustering to identify suspicious network activity and categorize traffic patterns. The study aims to enhance cybersecurity threat detection by analyzing network traffic data, bytes exchanged, and security events.

## Key Features
- Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest identifies unusual network activity.

- Clustering Analysis: K-Means groups traffic into distinct behavior categories.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization using Tableau to analyze traffic trends.

- Feature Engineering: Bytes exchanged, timestamps, protocol types, and detection classifications.

- Model Performance: Optimized hyperparameters for better anomaly detection and cluster separation.
